= Release process
Since the project serves as a legacy for other projects, it should be given a non-"classic" release maven configuration.
The reason is that this would cause the target project to inherit the project settings, and that would lead to very unwanted events.
So all release settings should be hidden under a *parent-pom-release* `maven profile`.

== Deploy
If you want to release a SNAPSHOT version to the company nexus server, you must use the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -B -Pparent-pom-release clean deploy source:jar
----
* _mvn_ maven executable command
* _-B_ batch run - don't ask for console confirmations from maven
* _-Pparent-pom-release_ activates the 'parent-pom-release' maven profile
* _clean_ deletes `*/target` folders
* _deploy_ deploy command, which briefly does the following in main steps:
** compiles the code
** creates jar, war, pom packages
** copies the completed jar, war, pom packages to the local `.m2` repository
** uploads the completed jar, war, pom packages to the defined `snapshotRepository`, which is the company nexus
* _source:jar_ this is a switch to copy/play the source code to the nexus together with the created jar, war, pom packages

== Release
If we want to release a fixed version without SNAPSHOT markup.
The clean release process itself consists of 4 steps:

=== #1 Check
This step is used to verify from a technical point of view that all the settings and release requirements for maven are met.
In short, the following happens:
* all changes are committed
* the code can be translated 
* tests can be run successfully
* SCM settings are in place
* the versioning attempt is successful

[source,bash]
----
mvn -B -Pparent-pom-release release:prepare -DdryRun=true
----
* _mvn_ maven executable command
* _-B_ batch run - don't ask for console confirmations from maven
* _-Pparent-pom-release_ activates the 'parent-pom-release' maven profile
* _release:prepare_ part of maven-release-plugin, starts the release of the SCM side version
* *_-DdryRun=true_* option to make the version release only "virtual", so that it is only run for verification purposes

This step should run without any error messages. Any errors must be corrected, because the actual version release will not run.

=== #2 Cleaning
The temp files created during the test are deleted so they don't interfere with the real version release.

[source,bash]
----
mvn -B release:clean
----
* _mvn_ maven executable command
* _-B_ batch run - don't ask for console confirmations from maven
* _release:clean_ part of maven-release-plugin, cleans `target` directory and deletes temporary release files

=== #3 SCM version change
If steps #1 and #2 are successful, we will launch a real SCM version

[source,bash]
----
mvn -B -Pparent-pom-release release:prepare
----
* _mvn_ maven executable command
* _-B_ batch run - don't ask for console confirmations from maven
* _-Pparent-pom-release_ activates the 'parent-pom-release' maven profile
* _release:prepare_ part of maven-release-plugin, starts the release of the SCM side version

This step often fails on the first run (in a new environment) and these are the main reasons why:
* environment settings are not prepared to run console maven, git and java
* the local `settings.xml` file does not have the authentication details of the servers in pom.xml expanded
* the java version does not include server certificates (this is usually the biggest pain in the ass)

The command briefly does the following:

* checks described in point #1
* cut "-SNAPSHOT" from the version number
* compile
* upload local `.m2` directory
* commit
* create tag
* version number increment + "-SNAPSHOT" addition
* compile
* commit

After running the command, the version number in the local files will be incremented and committed.
The files include *release temporary files, which should not be deleted!*

=== #4 Nexus upload
Once we have completed point #3, all that remains is to make the packages.
It is important that the temporal files for point #3 are in the project!

----
mvn -B -Pparent-pom-release release:perform
----
* _mvn_ maven executable command
* _-B_ batch run - don't ask for console confirmations from maven
* _-Pparent-pom-release_ activates the 'parent-pom-release' maven profile
* _release:perform_ is part of maven-release-plugin, starts the release of the nexus-side version:
** removes source code marked with SCM TAG in temporal files
** create compile, jar, war, pom, source packages
** uploads to nexus

The most common error is that the SSL certificate on the nexus server is not included in our java version, so it runs to error.

== Release problems
Unfortunately, the above 4 steps will not always be successful, and often corrections have to be made.
The most common cases and their repair steps are explained in the following sections.
